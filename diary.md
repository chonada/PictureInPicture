# Task 1 -
- Change minSdkVersion to 21
- Ensure the code compiles.
- Run it on a version lower than 31 and check if PIP works
- If it fails then put those apis that crash under a runtime build version check.
- Since the PIP was introduced only on Android 8 (API Level 26) run it on a lower version (pre 26) device or emulator check the behaviour.
